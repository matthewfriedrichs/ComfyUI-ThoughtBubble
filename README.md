# ComfyUI-ThoughtBubble
Thought Bubble is a custom node for ComfyUI that provides an interactive canvas to build and manage your prompts in a more visual and organized way. Think of it as a whiteboard for your ideas, allowing you to link different concepts, create conditional logic, and dynamically generate prompts using a powerful set of commands.
